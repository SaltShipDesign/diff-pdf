- Put the latest diff-pdf binary in a folder you want to mount from the docker host.
- Put the "source" pdf files in the same folder
- mount this folder to the docker image

Navigate to the mount folder on the docker host and then:
>> snap install docker
>> docker pull ubuntu
>> Copy the Dockerfile from this repo to the root of the diff-pdf binary folder
>> Copy the folder docker and poppler-libs from this repo to the root of the diff-pdf binary folder
>> docker build -t diff-pdf-image .
>> docker run --rm -v <mount folder full path>:/data diff-pdf-image <pdf-file-1> <pdf-file-2> <output-pdf>

Example:
>> docker run --rm -v D:\Temp\_diff-pdf\pdfs:/data diff-pdf-image pdf_A.pdf pdf_B.pdf custom-diff.pdf

After completion, the <output-pdf> will be available in the mount folder
